luit with support of KOI7-N0/N1

It's luit from http://invisible-island.net/luit/luit.html with patches to support KOI7-NO/N1 code pages. Mainly to use with old computers emulators like simh.

By now luit support output KOI7-N0 (ASCII) and KOI7-N1 switching with SO/SI control codes. Keyboard switching does not work.
